# Leftbehind_Children
Data Mining for Chinese Left-behind Children Problem

The project implement feature selection and modelling for left-behind children problem by Python. Feature selection consists of **filter** and **wrapper** approaches. Models contains **support vector regression(SVR)** and **neural network regression(NNR)**.

Filter approach is included in `3.filter method for features selection`.

The models built using filtered features are in `4.svr/1.model by filter method`, `5.nnr/1.model by filter method`.

Wrapper approach and corresponding models are included in `4.svr/2.genetic algorithm`, `4.svr/3.clustering method`, `5.nnr/2.genetic algorithm` and `5.nnr/3.clustering method`.

`7.models` contains several selected SVR models.
